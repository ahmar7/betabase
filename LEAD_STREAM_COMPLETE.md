#### 🔄 Automatic Activity Logging

**Backend Changes** (`BE/controllers/crmController.js`):

1. **When Lead is Created**:
   - Logs all initial field values
   - Example: `"Lead created: firstName: 'John'; lastName: 'Doe'; email: 'john@example.com'; phone: '123456789'; status: 'New'"`

2. **When Lead is Edited**:
   - Tracks all field changes
   - Logs field updates: `"firstName: from 'John' to 'Jonathan'; email: from 'old@example.com' to 'new@example.com'"`
   - Separate log for status changes: `"Status changed from 'New' to 'Active'"`

3. **When Agent is Assigned/Changed**:
   - Logs assignment changes
   - Example: `"Assigned to: John Smith (admin)"` or `"Agent changed from 'Unassigned' to 'Jane Doe'"`

4. **When Comments are Added**:
   - Any user (superadmin, admin, subadmin) can add comments
   - Comments show with full timestamp and user info

### 3. **Activity Types**

| Type | Color | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `created` | Green (#4caf50) | Lead was created |
| `comment` | Blue (#2196f3) | User added a comment |
| `status_change` | Orange (#ff9800) | Lead status changed |
| `assignment_change` | Purple (#9c27b0) | Agent assigned/changed |
| `field_update` | Cyan (#00bcd4) | Other fields updated |

### 4. **Smart Timestamp Formatting**
- **Just now** - less than 1 minute ago
- **5 mins ago** - less than 1 hour ago
- **2 hours ago** - less than 24 hours ago
- **Today 14:30** - today's activities
- **Yesterday 09:15** - yesterday's activities
- **3 days ago 16:45** - within last week
- **Dec 15, 2024 12:00** - older activities

### 5. **Responsive Design**
- **Desktop**: Full layout with sidebar
- **Tablet**: Optimized grid layout
- **Mobile**: Stack layout, collapsible sidebar with overlay
- **All components** adapt font sizes and spacing

### 6. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Auto-refresh**: Silent updates every 30 seconds (doesn't show loading spinner)
- **useCallback**: Memoized functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient API calls**: Uses axiosService with proper authentication
- **Lazy loading**: Activities load progressively

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new lead → Check activity log shows creation
- [ ] Edit lead fields → Check activity log shows changes
- [ ] Change lead status → Check separate status change activity
- [ ] Assign lead to agent → Check assignment activity
- [ ] Reassign to different agent → Check assignment change
- [ ] Add comment → Check comment appears in stream
- [ ] Test on mobile → Check responsive design
- [ ] Test auto-refresh → Wait 30 seconds, check for updates
- [ ] Test Enter key → Add comment using Enter
- [ ] Test timestamps → Check relative time formatting

## 🔧 Configuration

### Auto-Refresh Interval
Located in `LeadStream.jsx` line ~90:
```javascript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
    fetchLeadData(true);
}, 30000); // 30 seconds
```

### Activity Limit
Currently shows all activities. To limit, modify backend:
```javascript
// In activityController.js
Activity.find({ leadId })
    .sort({ createdAt: -1 })
    .limit(50) // Add limit
```

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

The Lead Stream feature is now fully functional and ready for production use. All automatic logging is in place, and the UI is modern, fast, and responsive.

**Next Steps**:
1. Test all functionality
2. Customize colors/branding if needed
3. Add more activity types if required
4. Consider adding filters (by type, date, user)
5. Consider adding search functionality
