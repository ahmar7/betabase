# Bulk Lead Activation with Persistent Progress Tracking

## Implementation Complete ✅

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive bulk lead activation system with **persistent progress tracking** that survives page refreshes and navigation. The progress tracker displays real-time updates on user creation and email delivery.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Persistent Progress Tracker**
- **Component**: `ActivationProgressTracker.jsx`
- **Location**: `FE/src/jsx/components/ActivationProgressTracker.jsx`
- Automatically appears when activation starts
- **Persists across**:
  - Page refreshes
  - Navigation to other pages
  - Browser tab switches
- Uses `localStorage` for persistence
- Auto-dismisses 2 minutes after completion

### 2. **Real-Time Progress Updates**
Shows detailed progress with:
- **User Creation Progress**:
  - Activated count
  - Skipped count (already existing users)
  - Failed count
  - Overall percentage

- **Email Delivery Progress**:
  - Emails sent
  - Emails pending
  - Emails failed
  - Separate email progress tracking

### 3. **Batch Email Processing**
- Sends 5 emails at a time (configurable)
- 1-second delay between batches
- Rate limiting to respect SMTP provider limits
- Non-blocking: Users can continue working

4. Email sent with credentials
5. Toast notification confirms success

### Bulk Lead Activation
1. Select multiple leads using checkboxes
2. Click **"Activate (N)"** button in bulk actions bar
3. **Progress tracker appears** in bottom-right corner
4. Shows:
   - User creation progress
   - Email sending progress
   - Real-time status messages
5. Progress persists even if you:
   - Navigate away
   - Refresh the page
   - Switch tabs
6. Auto-dismisses after completion (or manual dismiss)

## 📊 Progress Data Structure

### localStorage Key: `activationProgress`
```json
{
  "total": 100,
  "activated": 75,
  "skipped": 10,
  "failed": 5,
  "emailsSent": 60,
  "emailsFailed": 2,
  "emailsPending": 13,
  "percentage": 90,
  "msg": "Sending emails... 60/75 sent, 2 failed",
  "completed": false,
  "type": "progress",
  "completedAt": 1234567890
}
```

---

## 🔐 Permissions

### Who Can Activate Leads?
- ✅ **Superadmin**: Full access
- ✅ **Admin**: Full access
- ❌ **Subadmin**: Cannot activate leads

---

## 🎯 Rate Limiting (Email)

### Email Batch Configuration
```javascript
const BATCH_SIZE = 5; // 5 emails at a time
const DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 1000; // 1 second delay
```

### Why Rate Limiting?
- Hostinger SMTP has hourly limits
- Prevents overwhelming email server
- Reduces spam flags
- Ensures delivery success

### Email Delivery Process
1. User creation completes first (fast)
2. All emails queued
3. Emails sent in batches of 5
4. 1-second pause between batches
5. Progress tracked separately
6. Failed emails logged but don't block process

```

### Adjust Auto-Dismiss Time

## 📌 Important Notes

1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
   - Used for real-time progress updates
   - Connection stays open during process
   - Automatically closed on completion/error

2. **localStorage Persistence**
   - Syncs across all tabs/windows
   - Survives page refresh
   - Auto-cleans old completed tasks

3. **Non-Blocking Operation**
   - Email sending happens in background
   - Users can continue CRM work
   - Progress visible but not intrusive

4. **Error Resilience**
   - Individual failures don't stop batch
   - Email failures tracked but don't block
   - Clear error reporting in UI

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Progress Tracker Not Appearing
- Check browser localStorage enabled
- Check console for errors
- Verify API endpoints returning SSE

### Emails Not Sending
- Check `BE/utils/sendEmail.js` configuration
- Verify SMTP credentials in `BE/config/config.env`
- Check Hostinger SMTP limits

### Progress Not Persisting
- Check localStorage not full
- Verify no console errors
- Check browser allows localStorage
