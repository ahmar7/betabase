# ‚ú® New Features Summary

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### Feature 1: üîî Background Activation Toast
**When**: User closes progress tracker while activation is incomplete
**What happens**:
```
Toast appears: "‚è≥ Activation continues in background! 30 lead(s) remaining. 
                You can refresh the page to see the tracker again."
```
**Result**: User knows work continues, can refresh to track again

### Feature 2: ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple Activation Warning
**When**: User starts 2nd activation while 1st is still running
**What happens**:
1. **Confirmation dialog shows warning**:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Previous Activation In Progress!
   There's an ongoing activation with 30 lead(s) remaining.
   Starting a new activation will dismiss the tracker for the 
   previous one (but it will continue in the background).
   ```
2. **After confirming, toast appears**:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Previous activation still in progress! 30 lead(s) remaining.
   Starting new activation will dismiss the old one.
   ```
3. **Old tracker dismissed, new tracker appears**

**Result**: User is fully informed, both activations complete successfully
