# 🔄 Page Refresh Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
When refreshing the page during bulk activation, progress showed all 0s and no real-time updates.

## Solution
Added **backend session storage** and **frontend polling** to maintain progress across page refreshes.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Backend
1. **Session Storage** - Store progress in memory with sessionId
2. **New Endpoint** - `GET /crm/activation/progress/:sessionId`
3. **All Updates Stored** - Every progress update saved to backend

### Frontend
1. **SessionId Generated** - Unique ID for each activation
2. **Backend Polling** - Check for updates every 2 seconds
3. **Auto-Resume** - Detect ongoing activation on page load

---

## ✨ How It Works

### Before Refresh:
```
SSE Stream → Real-time updates ✅
```

### After Refresh:
```
Backend Polling (every 2 sec) → Real-time updates ✅
```
