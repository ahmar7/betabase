"Hi! Let me show you the new bulk activation feature.

First, I'll select a few leads... done.

Now I click 'Activate' and watch this...

See this beautiful progress tracker? It shows:
- How many users we've created
- How many emails we've sent
- Real-time status updates

And the best part? Watch this...
[Refresh page]
It's still there! Even after refresh!
