# Activation Progress Tracker Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ 404 Error on Progress Polling
**Problem**: The frontend was polling `/api/v1/crm/activation/progress/:sessionId` but getting 404 errors because:
- The session might not exist yet (activation just starting)
- The session might have expired
- Network timing issues

**Solution**:
- Added retry logic with `consecutiveErrors` counter
- Only stop polling after 5 consecutive 404 errors
- Added better error messages to distinguish between "starting" vs "expired" sessions
- Keep polling initially to allow session to be created on backend

### 2. 🔄 Overlapping Progress Dialogs
**Problem**: When refreshing the page and starting a new activation, old progress dialogs would appear alongside new ones, creating confusion.

**Solution**:
- Added `dismissedActivationSessions` array in localStorage to track dismissed sessions
- When starting new activation, automatically dismiss any old progress
- Clean up old progress data before initializing new activation
- Check dismissed list on component mount to prevent showing dismissed sessions

### 3. ❌ Progress Tracker Not Dismissing Properly
**Problem**: 
- Clicking X didn't permanently dismiss the tracker
- Completed progress didn't auto-close after 2 minutes
- Polling continued even after dismissal

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### a) Permanent Dismissal on X Click
```javascript
const handleClose = React.useCallback(() => {
    // Add sessionId to dismissed list
    if (currentProgress?.sessionId) {
        const dismissedSessions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('dismissedActivationSessions') || '[]');
        dismissedSessions.push(currentProgress.sessionId);
        
        // Keep only last 50 to prevent localStorage bloat
        const recentDismissed = dismissedSessions.slice(-50);
        localStorage.setItem('dismissedActivationSessions', JSON.stringify(recentDismissed));
    }
    
    // Clean up
    localStorage.removeItem('activationProgress');
    setVisible(false);
}, [progress]);
```

#### b) Auto-Close After 2 Minutes
```javascript
const startAutoCloseTimer = () => {
    autoCloseTimerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
        handleClose();
    }, 120000); // 2 minutes
};
```

#### c) Stop Polling on Completion
```javascript
if (backendProgress.completed) {
    clearInterval(pollInterval);
    pollInterval = null;
    startAutoCloseTimer();
}
```

## Code Changes Summary

### `FE/src/jsx/components/ActivationProgressTracker.jsx`

1. **Added dismissed sessions tracking**:
   - New localStorage key: `dismissedActivationSessions`
   - Stores array of dismissed sessionIds
   - Keeps only last 50 sessions to prevent bloat

2. **Improved error handling**:
   - Added `consecutiveErrors` counter
   - Tolerates up to 5 consecutive errors before stopping
   - Distinguishes between 404 (session not found) and other errors

3. **Auto-close functionality**:
   - Uses `useRef` for timer to avoid stale closures
   - Starts 2-minute timer when activation completes
   - Auto-dismisses and cleans up localStorage

4. **Better state management**:
   - `handleClose` uses `useCallback` with proper dependencies
   - Checks dismissed list on mount
   - Cleans up old dismissed sessions (keeps last 50)

### `FE/src/jsx/Admin/CRM/leads.js`

1. **Clean up before new activation**:
```javascript
// Clean up any old progress before starting new activation
const oldProgress = localStorage.getItem('activationProgress');
if (oldProgress) {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(oldProgress);
    if (parsed.sessionId) {
        // Add old session to dismissed list
        const dismissedSessions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('dismissedActivationSessions') || '[]');
        dismissedSessions.push(parsed.sessionId);
        localStorage.setItem('dismissedActivationSessions', JSON.stringify(dismissedSessions));
    }
}

// Clear old progress
localStorage.removeItem('activationProgress');
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start bulk activation - progress shows correctly
- [ ] Refresh page during activation - progress continues from where it left off
- [ ] Click X button - progress dismisses and doesn't reappear on refresh
- [ ] Let activation complete - auto-closes after 2 minutes
- [ ] Start new activation while old one is showing - old one dismisses automatically
- [ ] Get 404 errors initially - keeps polling and doesn't stop immediately
- [ ] Get 5+ consecutive 404s - stops polling and shows error

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: No more overlapping progress dialogs
2. **Persistent Dismissal**: Users can close completed progress and it stays closed
3. **Auto-cleanup**: Old completed progress auto-dismisses after 2 minutes
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Tolerates temporary 404s while session is being created
5. **Performance**: Limits localStorage bloat by keeping only recent dismissed sessions
6. **Clean State**: Starting new activation properly cleans up old state

## Technical Details

### Session Dismissal Flow
```
User clicks X → Add sessionId to dismissed list → Clear localStorage → Hide component
       ↓
On next mount → Check dismissed list → Don't show if sessionId is dismissed
```

### Auto-Close Flow
```
Activation completes → Start 2-minute timer → Auto-close after timeout
                    ↓
              Update localStorage with completedAt timestamp
```

### 404 Retry Logic
```
Polling attempt → 404 error → Increment counter (1/5)
                           ↓
                Keep polling (session might be starting)
                           ↓
         After 5 consecutive 404s → Stop polling + Show error
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Consider using SSE instead of polling for real-time updates
2. **Notification Persistence**: Store notification in database instead of just localStorage
3. **Multiple Sessions**: Support tracking multiple concurrent activations
4. **Better Error Recovery**: Add "Retry" button for failed activations
