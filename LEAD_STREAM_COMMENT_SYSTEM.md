likes: [{
  userId, userName, userRole, likedAt
}]

isPinned: Boolean
pinnedBy: { userId, userName, pinnedAt }

attachments: [{
  fileName, fileUrl, fileType, fileSize, uploadedAt
}]

- Delete permissions enforced at model level
- Frontend hides unavailable actions

---

## 📈 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Database Indexes:**
```javascript
{ leadId: 1, isPinned: -1, createdAt: -1 } // Fast pinned sorting
{ leadId: 1, parentCommentId: 1 }          // Fast nested replies
{ 'mentions.userId': 1 }                   // Fast mention lookups
```

### **Frontend Optimizations:**
- `useCallback` for handlers to prevent re-renders
- Memoized permission checks
- Lazy-load nested replies (on demand)
- Search results cached until cleared
- Efficient state updates

---

## 🔄 **Data Flow**

### **Adding a Comment:**
1. User types comment (can include @mentions)
2. Frontend sends to: `POST /crm/lead/:leadId/comment`
3. Backend:
   - Extracts mentions from text
   - Creates activity with mentions array
   - Returns new comment
4. Frontend refreshes stream (new comment appears)

### **Like a Comment:**
1. User clicks like button
2. Frontend: `POST /crm/lead/:leadId/comment/:commentId/like`
3. Backend checks if already liked → toggle
4. Frontend updates local state immediately (optimistic UI)

### **Nested Reply:**
1. User clicks "Reply" button
2. Dialog opens with parent comment context
3. User writes reply (can @mention)
4. Backend:
   - Creates new activity with `parentCommentId`
   - Adds reply ID to parent's `replies` array
   - Extracts mentions
5. Frontend shows reply count, loads on expand

## 🐛 **Error Handling**

### **Comprehensive Coverage:**
- Input validation (empty comments, etc.)
- Permission checks (403 forbidden)
- Not found errors (404)
- Network errors
- Structured error messages

## 🎯 **Permission Enforcement**

### **Backend Security:**
```javascript
// In activityModel.js
canUserDelete(userId, userRole) {
    if (userRole === 'superadmin') return true;
    if (userRole === 'admin') {
        if (currentUserId === authorId) return true;
        if (authorRole === 'subadmin') return true;
        return false;
    }
    if (userRole === 'subadmin') {
        return currentUserId === authorId;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### **Frontend Permission Checks:**
```javascript
const canDeleteComment = (comment) => {
    const userRole = currentUserLatest.role;
    const userId = currentUserLatest._id;
    const authorId = comment.createdBy?.userId;
    const authorRole = comment.createdBy?.userRole;

    if (userRole === 'superadmin') return true;
    if (userRole === 'admin') {
        if (userId === authorId) return true;
        if (authorRole === 'subadmin') return true;
        return false;
    }
    if (userRole === 'subadmin') {
        return userId === authorId;
    }
    return false;
};
```

- ✅ All core features (edit, delete, like, pin, important)
- ✅ Quote replies and nested replies
- ✅ Mentions detection and highlighting
- ✅ Edit history tracking
- ✅ Comment search
- ✅ Role-based permissions

### **What Needs Additional Setup:**

  - Export endpoint
  - Formatting logic

---

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables:**
All existing `.env` variables work as-is. The enhanced comment system uses:
- Existing MongoDB connections (main + CRM databases)
- Existing auth system
- Existing user management

### **No Breaking Changes:**
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Backward compatible with old comments
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing fields
- ✅ No database migration required (Mongoose auto-creates)

---

## 🎓 **How It Works Internally**

### **Comment Lifecycle:**

1. **Creation:**
   ```
   User types → Frontend validates → API call → Backend creates → 
   Extracts @mentions → Saves to DB → Returns success → 
   Frontend refreshes stream
   ```

2. **Edit:**
   ```
   User clicks edit → Dialog opens → User edits → API call → 
   Backend saves to editHistory → Updates comment → 
   Sets isEdited=true → Returns → Frontend refreshes
   ```

3. **Delete:**
   ```
   User clicks delete → Confirmation → API call → 
   Backend checks permissions → Sets isDeleted=true → 
   Tracks deletedBy → Returns → Frontend removes from view
   ```

4. **Like:**
   ```
   User clicks like → API call → Backend checks if already liked → 
   Toggle like in array → Returns new likes array → 
   Frontend updates state immediately (optimistic UI)
   ```

---
