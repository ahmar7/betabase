## 🔧 Email Rate Limits

### Current Settings:
- **5 emails per batch**
- **1 second delay** between batches
- **Rate**: ~5 emails/second = 300/minute

### If Hitting Limits:
Reduce in `BE/controllers/activateLeads.js` (line ~74):
```javascript
const BATCH_SIZE = 3;              // Slower
const DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 2000; // 2 seconds
```
